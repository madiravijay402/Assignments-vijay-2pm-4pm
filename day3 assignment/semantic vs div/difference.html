        <p>
            <em>Semantic tags</em> clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. 
            <br> Examples include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt;. 
            <br> These tags provide better accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

        <p>
            <em>&lt; div &gt;</em> is a generic container used to group elements for styling or scripting purposes. 
            <br> It does not convey any specific meaning about its content. 
            <br> While &lt;div&gt; is versatile, overusing it can lead to less readable code and poorer accessibility.
