        <h2>The Benefits of Regular Exercise</h2>
        <p>Regular exercise is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. It helps to improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, and enhance flexibility. Engaging in physical activity can also boost mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
        <p>Incorporating exercise into your daily routine can lead to increased energy levels, better sleep quality, and improved overall mood. Whether it's walking, running, cycling, or participating in sports, finding an activity you enjoy can make it easier to stay consistent.</p>
        <p>Remember to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Always consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any new exercise program, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.</p>
